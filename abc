Absolutely! Here's a refined 1.5-minute version that keeps the tone balanced and professional, while including the limitations, challenges, goals, and deliverables:


---

Opening (10s):
“Hello everyone, I’ll be giving a quick overview of the CEP-IT RECON NEXTGEN initiative, which is focused on modernizing our bank’s reconciliation platform.”


---

Current Landscape & Limitations (20s):
“Our current system has been reliable, but it’s built on a legacy monolithic architecture with limited scalability. It primarily supports batch processing, which limits our ability to perform real-time or intra-day reconciliation. There’s also a need for improved support for many-to-many transaction matching, flexible integration, and stronger analytics capabilities.”


---

Key Challenges (20s):
“Some of the main challenges include performance constraints during high-volume periods, lack of advanced matching logic, and a rigid integration framework. These factors can make it harder to scale, respond quickly, and support evolving digital banking needs.”


---

Objective (15s):
“To address this, RECON NEXTGEN aims to deliver a scalable, cloud-native solution that enables real-time processing, advanced matching logic, and better visibility for both users and stakeholders.”


---

Solution & Deliverables (25s):
“The architecture includes a modular reconciliation engine built with Spring Boot microservices, covering data ingestion, matching, discrepancy detection, and auto-allocation.
Frontend is powered by Angular and integrates with Power BI for rich visual analytics.
The backend uses relational databases for transactions and non-relational ones for metadata and audit trails.
We’re also integrating an AI-Fix layer using LLMs like Mistral to provide suggestions and automated resolutions.”


---

Current Status (10s):
“We’ve completed the feasibility study and POC, and we’re on track toward delivering a modern, intelligent reconciliation platform aligned with the future of banking.”
