I would strongly recommend Dhrite for this role because she has extensive full stack experience at Latlong, a geospatial technology startup where she delivered exceptional results. She independently developed a comprehensive real-time vehicle tracking system using Next.js, React with TypeScript, and MapLibre for interactive mapping. Her technical expertise spans frontend development with Tailwind CSS, backend API development in Golang, PostgreSQL database management, and advanced geospatial algorithms including DBSCAN clustering for GPS optimization. She implemented complex features like reverse geocoding, historical route visualization, and real-time location tracking. Beyond her technical skills, she served as the primary POC for production issues, demonstrating strong problem-solving abilities and customer service excellence. Her proven track record of building scalable, production-ready applications makes her an invaluable addition to our team.
